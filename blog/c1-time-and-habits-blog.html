    <h1>Second Blog!</h1>
    <p>I have tried mediation before itâ€™s very difficult to centre and calm yourself. </p>
    <p>I am going to try the Pomodoro technique in the future. I found that by keeping things small to begin very interesting. The idea of growing a project like a seed.</p>
    <p>I imagine that focusing breaking down a project and indeed life in to smaller tasks will something I will try. I have tried breaking issues and project in the past but I see there is allot more reading to do on the subject.</p>
    <p>I will try to combine the Pomodoro in relation with keeping smaller simpler tasks. These seem very similar techniques. </p>
