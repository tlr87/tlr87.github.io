      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Responsive webpages look to keep consistent aesthetic and functional experience for the user no matter what the screen size. Web sites should be designed to handle desktop, mobile phone and tablet screens in order to qualify to be a responsive website.

      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Semantic structure in the web is the way in which we go about and structure our documents with the appropriate tags. Traditionally in HTML this was done with Class (class) or an Identity (id)&nbsp;tag to describe what an element is used for. Now
          HTML 5 is now using different element types that better define what it can be used for, an example of this can be shown by replacing &lt;div id=&rdquo;nav&rdquo;&gt; with &lt;nav&gt;.</p>

      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to  reflect on? </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p> The Idea of having of using a row and 12 column design and defining the page out in percentages was really interesting. Epically when it came to the mathematics when working this out. An example of this is knowing what 1/12 of 100% is. This further
          expanded my understanding about responsive web pages. <br> In addition to this I was surprised that @Media had orientation logic too.
