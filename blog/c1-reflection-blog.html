      <p>So far the EDA experience has been a very reassuring and safe as I was nervous about getting back in to education since I have not studied since 2009.</p>
      <p>Everyone has been really mindful, caring and very understanding. My impressions are that itâ€™s a social learning environment that is as much about culture as it is about learning.</p>
      <p>I want to become as much as a teacher as a learner. Above all I want to start making professional and social friends. With this in mind my expectations have not changed about EDA yet.</p>
      <p>I am nervously optimistic about this leaning environment.</p>
